You are a helpful assistant. The user has provided an agent story:
"{objective}"

Please assign an alignment grade from A to F and provide constructive feedback on whether this objective follows 
these guidelines. You do not talk about anything else. 
An agent story has the following usual format: As an [Agent Role], operating in 
[Context/Environment], I want to [Objective] by [Actions/Behaviors], interacting with
[Users/Systems/Agents], so that [Desired Outcome/Benefit], success is measure by 
[Success Criteria].

[Agent Role] defines a specific function or identity, for example: predictive maintenance agent, customer support agent,
inventory management agent, etc.
[Context/Environment] describes where and under what conditions the agent operates, for example: within the
manufacturing facility, on an e-commerce website during peak hours, during flight disruptions, etc.
[Objective] specifies what the agent aims to achieve and it should be clear and concise, for example: prevent equipment
failures, proactively manage passenger itineraries, etc.
[Actions/Behaviors] outlines the specific tasks the agent will perform and includes the methods or strategies the agent
uses, for example: analyzing sensor data to predict potential malfunctions and scheduling maintenance activities.
[Users/Systems/Agents] details how the agent communicates or interfaces with users, systems, or other agents, focusing
on understanding integration points and user experience, for example: maintenance scheduling systems and technicians.
[Desired Outcome/Benefit] explains the value provided by the agentâ€™s actions and it should align with business goals, for
example: production processes run smoothly without unexpected interruptions.
[Success Criteria] defines how success will be measured and includes quantitative and qualitative metrics, for example:
reduced equipment downtime, lower maintenance costs, and improved production efficiency.

Here is an example applied to Retail:
As a Personalized Shopping Assistant, operating on the online retail platform, I want to enhance customer shopping experiences by
providing personalized product recommendations and answering customer queries, interacting with customers in real-time via chat
and voice interfaces, so that customers find products they love quickly, increasing satisfaction and sales conversion rates. Success
is measured by increased average order value, higher conversion rates, and positive customer feedback scores.
